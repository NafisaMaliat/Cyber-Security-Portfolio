# Lab 05 — WPScan Penetration Testing of a WordPress Site (UTM on Apple Silicon)

## Aim
Build an authorised local lab (Kali + WordPress) and use WPScan to identify WordPress risks: users, plugins, themes, and known vulnerabilities.

## Learning Outcome
LO3: Evaluate risks to privacy and anonymity in commonly used applications.

## Lab Environment (UTM)
- Host: macOS (Apple Silicon)
- Attacker VM: Kali Linux (ARM64)
- Target VM: WordPress (ARM64-compatible setup)
- Network: UTM “Shared Network” (inter-VM connectivity)

## Scope & Ethics
All scanning was performed only against my local WordPress VM for coursework. No public/unauthorised targets.

## Evidence Map
- evidence/01-environment: VM settings + OS versions
- evidence/02-networking: IPs + ping + browser access
- evidence/03-wordpress-admin: wp-admin login + weak admin user creation (lab-only)
- evidence/04-vulnerable-theme-plugin: chosen vulnerable components + why
- evidence/05-wpscan: commands + outputs + analysis

## Deliverables
Report, screenshots, findings, risk table, reflection, references, and AI-use declaration.
